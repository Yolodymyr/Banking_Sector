# Banking_Sector
Banking Churn Analysis is my final and most comprehensive project from the IAMPM course. I used SQL, Python, and Power BI to analyze customer churn, segment risk groups, and build a predictive model. This project better reflects my current analytics toolkit in action.

# Banking Churn Analysis

This is my final project completed during the IAMPM Data Analytics course. The goal was to identify and analyze factors that contribute to customer churn in the banking sector and propose data-driven strategies to reduce it.

## Project Goals

- Predict which customers are likely to churn in the next 6 months
- Explore behavioral, demographic, and service-related features
- Build a simple churn prediction model
- Visualize churn insights and key customer segments in Power BI
- Present actionable business recommendations

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** – Data extraction, joins, grouping, filtering
- **Python** – Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (modeling)
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for churn trends and risk segments
- **Excel** – Initial data inspection
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Data exploration and feature engineering

---

## Project Files

- `Bank_base_start.xlsx` – Source dataset
- `Banking_project.ipynb` – Python notebook with EDA and churn model
- `Banking.sql` – SQL scripts for feature prep and segmentation
- `Banking_visual.pbix` – Power BI dashboard
- `churn_model.pkl` – Saved churn prediction model
- `Banking data Analysis.pptx` – Final presentation slides

## Key Insights

- High tenure + high balance customers show lower churn probability
- Customers with 3+ products and inactive accounts are at higher risk
- Germany shows the highest churn rate by region

---

## Recommendations

- Explore causes of elevated churn in Germany
- Proactively re-engage inactive users with targeted offers
- Focus retention efforts on customers with 3+ products
